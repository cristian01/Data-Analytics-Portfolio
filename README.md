## Analysing and predict house prices in King County, United States.
This project was part of "Data Analysis Using Python" and I was tasked to determine the market price of a house given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors etc. The dataset contains house sale prices for King County and was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-wwwcourseraorg-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDA0101ENSkillsNetwork20235326-2021-01-01).

## Identify crime location in San Francisco using Folium maps
On this small project we're going to identify and visualise the crime location in the city of San Francisco. The data we're working with is taken from police department incidents and imported from IBM cloud storage in csv format. For the purpose of this project, we assume the data have been cleaned and validated before. This was part of Data Visualization with Python course.
